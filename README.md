room-booking
============
The Room Booking project is a web application using Java Enterprise Platform. The main goal of the project is resolving issues related with handling room reservations. The solution introduces some simplifications in comparison to traditional method such as saving reservation details on paper sheets. Modern approach significantly improves managing rooms, particularly in the case of large universities that have many campuses located in different places. The project was subject of my engineering thesis under the title of ”Project and realization of university room booking system”.
